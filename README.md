# Scistatic
The focus of our project is to create a learning resources page - where students can access learning materials which are specially done in a way to help students understand the topics better. In addition to that, we have also included games, which are related to the topics, allowing students to learn in a fun way. The games are done in a way where students can memorise/remember key science terms better.
It is a platform that allows you to organize content, view it over and over again and answer questions instantly, without limits on physical space or schedules.
 
## Design Process
Since we intend to create an educational page for Secondary Students, we decided to use more vibrant/attractive colour palette.
For index.html:
 The main purpose of this page is to promote our features and beneifts of our website. Thus the main ideaa was to make the page look more appealing.
 
 For discovery pages:
  - The main idea was to create resources that would be useful/beneficial for students to undertsand better, thus we have created a hover over text for the diagrams.
  - As for the text, we deicded to divide the pages into sections.
  - For discovery 1.1, we wanted an interactive touch to our resources, therefore we created a hover over text for users to read more about it.

For games.html
- We have included 3 games; crossword, hangman and wordsearch.
- These games are created to help students remember, memorise and learn science contents in a fun, unique way.
- The games are based on the topics on the discovery pages.

Leaaderboard
- To encourage students to try out our games, as they would want attain high scores to be listed in top 10  rankings of the leaderboard.
