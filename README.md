# Scistatic
The focus of our project is to create a learning resources page - where students can access learning materials which are specially done in a way to help students understand the topics better. In addition to that, we have also included games, which are related to the topics, allowing students to learn in a fun way. The games are done in a way where students can memorise/remember key science terms better.
It is a platform that allows you to organize content, view it over and over again and answer questions instantly, without limits on physical space or schedules.
 
## Design Process
Since we intend to create an educational page for Secondary Students, we decided to use more vibrant/attractive colour palette.
For index.html:
 The main purpose of this page is to promote our features and beneifts of our website. Thus the main ideaa was to make the page look for appealing.
 
 For discovery pages:
  - The main idea was to create resources that would be useful/beneficial for students to undertsand better, thus we have created a hover over text for the diagrams.
  - As for the text, we deicded to divide the pages into sections.

User stories
- User-friendly sidebar menu that users can access to all pages of different topics 
- Registration page for users to sign in or create account
- Once logged in, the site will keep track of the user's activty such as their highscores for the games and their ranking
- User can choose to access the disccovery page/games page to learn more or test themselves
- The questions on the games will be based on the discovery pages.
- There are 3 games - Crossword, Hangman and WordSearch. Users can choose to play any of the games.
- Upon completion of a game, they will be given a score according to their performance
- A leaderboard will also be featured to showcase the top players of the game
- There would be an accounts page where it would it would display userâ€™s profile and game histories

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

## Technologies Used
Languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that I have used in my project:

-[Bootstrap](https://bootstrap.com)
    - The project used **Bootstrap** on our navigation bars, containers to make it mobile-responsive,
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.
-[Lottie](https://lottiefiles.com/)
    - The project uses **lottie** to add animations designs to our work.
-[rest.db](https://restdb.io/)
     -The project uses **rest.db** to keep database for our user's details.


## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
